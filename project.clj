          "<p>This library represents the core model and configuration for Caribou.
           Used alone, it is a powerful way to capture your data model *as data*,
           effectively shaping it as your application develops.  Once the data
           model is rendered in this malleable form, Caribou can harness that
           specification to do a variety of things, including constructing
           queries based on the relationships *between* models you define.
           This means it is possible to order or filter results based on
           conditions that exist in associated models!</p>

           <p>Also, this provides the basis for the other Caribou libraries,
           <a href=\"http://antler.github.com/caribou-frontend\">Caribou Frontend</a>
           <a href=\"http://antler.github.com/caribou-api\">Caribou API</a> and 
           <a href=\"http://antler.github.com/caribou-admin\">Caribou Admin</a>,
           each of which build in their own way upon this data model as a basis."}
